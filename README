To run this you need to first make the file.
After that just type in graph01 *file name*.
If you want to use stdin type in graph01 -. 
This activates the stdin stream.
To exit and print you need to Ctrl + D.
I have provided 4 tests. 
gr02 is the test that the professor gave us.
test1 shows functionality if more than 1 per number is added.
test2 showcases a case where you tried to input a number that was larger than the original size the list was given.
test3 showcases a bad edge with 3 numbers. you can change this one to showcase it for 1 number as well. They both work.
